# Smart Home - Home Assistant

Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is
able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for
automating control.

## Current Configuration

-   RaspberryPi 3B using the Hassbian installation -\>
    (<https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/hassbian/>).
-   Using also the Lovelace UI -\>
    (<https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/>).

## Hardware

I use a raspberry pi 3rd generation to run home assistant. In addition,
I use a Z-wave stick to control devices that use the z-wave protocol and
an RFX module for controlling devices that work on the 433mhz frequency
band. Because the raspberry pi is hanging in the meter closet, the smart
meter is also read via a P1 cable.
